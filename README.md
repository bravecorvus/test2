# Test 2, Question 11) c)

### By Andrew Lee


Please download all the files Except README.md

Right above the files on the left, there is a button, "Clone or Download". Click download. (Or download them individually by clicking on the blue file name, and right click Raw, under Raw, Blame, History on the top left of the page)

##How to Run
After downloading, copy all the files into the Desktop Directory.
Next, open a terminal window (best done on Mac, but will also work on Linux or Windows)
    
    cd ~/Desktop
    
Next Run "reccurancechecker.py" which will also run the a2-5.py files and save the correct values to use in the program automatically
Note: Unless the files a2.py, a3,py, a4,py, and a5,py are in the same directory as recurrancechecker.py, the code will not run correctly and will throw an error at runtime.

    python3 reccurancechecker.py
